		<h1>What is it?</h1>
		<p>It's a discord server, duh. Seriously though, egg is a fun, small(ish) roleplay discord server based around eggs. Now you may ask "What do you mean based around eggs?", well to that I say, I dunno it has lots of egg puns and the pepole are eggs. It has a ton of bots that have some cool features like a curency system, random memes, and other stuff too!</p>
		<h1>Why should I care?</h1>
		<p>Personally, I like the egg server a lot and think it's a fun ever growing community of pepole who just wanna mess around. But it's up to you what you want to do in the server, you could share my opinion in just messing around, or you could take everything really seriously, as I said it's up to you what you want to do.</p>
		<h1>Where do I join?</h1>
		<p>Well, you can use <a href="https://discord.gg/tgxtHANTnt">this handy dandy invite link right here</a>, use the thing in the top right corner of this page, but sadly not find us on discovery. The reason that is, is because for a server to be on discovery it has to meet a bunch of requirements, one of which being it has to have at least 8,000 members, we don't even have 1,000 yet! So please join so we can make it to discovery!</p>
