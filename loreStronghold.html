		<h1>What's the lore stronghold?</h1>
		<p>It's a fun name I came up with for a place to look at a bunch of lore stuff, you can check here if you want more info on something or just to look at some of the lore in general.</p>
		
		
		<h1>Alternate dimensions</h1>
		<p>The egg world uses the many worlds interpretation. The many worlds interpretation is basically where anytime a choice is made the world splits into two. One world for the first option and another world for the other option. For example, do I go down this creepy alleyway or not? There are now two universes, one where you went down the creepy alleyway, and one where you didn't.</p>
		<p>However, one extra rule for the egg server is that if you meet a you from another universe both you and the the other you are destroyed. The reason for this is because you and the other you have the opposite energy.</p>
		<p>A final thing about alternate dimensions is that they are currently inaccessible due to a device created by meggtech.</p>
		
		<h1>The War</h1>
		<p>A while ago there was a war between eggs and omelettes, the omelettes lost the war and were conquered by the eggs. Now a new war is happening one between the egg country and a different species of egg called the Deviled eggs. There has also risen the Yolk Federation, combining all intelligent yolk species. The War is now at a halt, because the Yolk Federation and Deviled eggs have discovered Eggbilities appearing only in Eggs. The civil war is rising, the Pro-Equals who demand equality to both types of Eggs, fighting the Pro-Eggbilities who want the gifted eggs to rule.</p>
