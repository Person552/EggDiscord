		<h1>What's the lore stronghold?</h1>
		<p>It's a fun name I came up with for a place to look at a bunch of lore stuff, you can check here if you want more info on something or just to look at some of the lore in general.</p>
		
		
		<h1>Alternate dimensions</h1>
		<p>The egg world uses the many worlds interpretation. The many worlds interpretation is basically where anytime a choice is made the world splits into two. One world for the first option and another world for the other option. For example, do I go down this creepy alleyway or not? There are now two universes, one where you went down the creepy alleyway, and one where you didn't.</p>
		<p>However, one extra rule for the egg server is that if you meet a you from another universe both you and the the other you are destroyed. The reason for this is because you and the other you have the opposite energy.</p>
		<p>A final thing about alternate dimensions is that they are currently inaccessible due to a device created by meggtech.</p>
		
		<h1>The Ages</h1>
		<p>This is a section about the diffrent ages of egg, writen by discord user Eleggtrix.</p>
		
		<h2>The Creation Age</h2>
		<p>This is still being debated on today, if this was from Eggod, or by natural causes. Some people think its Eggod's doing, since hes clearly a god, others think that teggnically Eggod was King Egg around that time, he couldnt make the Egg as it is. Egg also think that it was another god's doing, with King egg not being a god, maybe he was blessed by another god to become one. 
		Also Egg bomber go brrrrrrrr.</p>
		
		<h2>The Preseggdential Age</h2>
		<p>This is was when the first egglection happened. This was for the title of the preseggdent. This was a fierce battle between Harambegg and Eggxotec, but eggxotec managed to win. He did many good things for Egg, adding towns and jobs with the help of people like Persegg and Megging, and will do many more soon on. This is irreggvalent to the preseggdents but the EBI (eggaral bureau of investigation) started here. The eleggtion for Vice presideggnt consisted of Megging and Donald, but this was not as great as the Preseggdent eleggtion. Megging, in a coat of rage, banned Donald Egg Trump from Egg. She was quickly punished for her actions, but will return...
</p>
		<h2>The Poligono15 age</h2>
		<p><em>Poligono15</em></p>
		
		<h2>The Cloning Age</h2>
		<p>Eggy Man 2100 discovered a mysterious plant that could reproduce eggs. These egg were thought to be emotionless, but that was just the way that they were taught, and could experience emotion if they were born in a regular environment. They made cloning factories and islands to prepare troops for the attack on the omelets</p>
		
		<h2>The Omelet Age</h2>
		<p>The omelets started rising up, and destroying the eggs. We fought back, and conquered most omelets.  I want to keep this brief for a particular friend of mine, but this is all you need to know. I'll take some words from Harambegg. "Then, the Egg Government launched an attack on the Omeletteâ€™s home country, Omelettia. The attack was a massive bombing sweep and destroyed all but a few omelettes." Around this time, Harambegg and Donald Egg Trump were fighting for eggsedent but Donald clutched it from 16-7 to 18-25. This was also the time Peggophile Deleted A bunch of roles before being banned from Egg.</p>
		
		<h2>The Yolk Age</h2>
		<p>Accidently deleted this part so basically we recked the Yolk Federation :DDDD
The Deviled Eggs (a different species of Egg that are evil) saw this and out of pure disgust made the Yolk Federation, a federation of Eggs that included but not limited to: Deviled Eggs, Scrambled Eggs and hard-boiled eggs(these are neutral). We fought against the Yolk Federation, and there ruins are a hit spot for tourists. They ARE still out there though, so watch out. Also I believe this is the time that the second reeleggtion would be announced due to the pres being offline too much. This sparked some Deviled Egg called InkyFan to frame me of murder, and being too scared to come to trial. this eleggtion also appeared to have one person FAKING DM's to try to get the other one out. We believe Personal Bodegguard faked the Dm's but he didnt get punished since we have no proof.</p>

		<h2>The Current Age</h2>
		<p>Megging had gone out and made Meggtech, a company working to grant powers to the eggs and to make new weapons. They had been pretty sketchy, but we will never know if their intentions were to control the world or help them. However, she was losing an eleggtion so she tried to cheat then failed so she decided to remove all the roles. This gave her the second BAN in the server. We tried to have an eleggtion, but it didn't go so well. Now, We are having I think the 4th Presidential egglection.</p>
		
		<h1>The War</h1>
		<p>A while ago there was a war between eggs and omelettes, the omelettes lost the war and were conquered by the eggs. Now a new war is happening one between the egg country and a different species of egg called the Deviled eggs. There has also risen the Yolk Federation, combining all intelligent yolk species. The War is now at a halt, because the Yolk Federation and Deviled eggs have discovered Eggbilities appearing only in Eggs. The civil war is rising, the Pro-Equals who demand equality to both types of Eggs, fighting the Pro-Eggbilities who want the gifted eggs to rule.</p>
