		<h1>What's the lore stronghold?</h1>
		<p>It's a fun name I came up with for a place to look at a bunch of lore stuff, you can check here if you want more info on something or just to look at some of the lore in general.</p>
		<h1>Abilities</h1>
		<p>Abilities are like superpowers, they give you some kinda control over a certain thing. Here is a list of abilites! (If you wanna see who has what abilites <a href="https://discord.gg/tgxtHANTnt">join the discord server</a>)</p>
		<ul>
			<li><p>Telekinesis</p></li>
			<li><p>Pyrokinesis</p></li>
			<li><p>Aerokinesis</p></li>
			<li><p>Hydrokinesis</p></li>
			<li><p>Geokinesis</p></li>
			<li><p>Azur Pyrokinesis</p></li>
			<li><p>Cryokinesis</p></li>
			<li><p>Tectokinesis</p></li>
			<li><p>Dimensikinesis</p></li>
			<li><p>Ferrokinesis</p></li>
		</ul>
		
		<h1>Alternate dimensions</h1>
		<p>The egg world uses the many worlds interpretation. The many worlds interpretation is basically where anytime a choice is made the world splits into two. One world for the first option and another world for the other option. For example, do I go down this creepy alleyway or not? There are now two universes, one where you went down the creepy alleyway, and one where you didn't.</p>
		<p>However, one extra rule for the egg server is that if you meet a you from another universe both you and the the other you are destroyed. The reason for this is because you and the other you have the opposite energy.</p>
