		<h1>What's the lore stronghold?</h1>
		<p>It's a fun name I came up with for a place to look at a bunch of lore stuff, you can check here if you want more info on something or just to look at some of the lore in general.</p>
		<h1>Abilities</h1>
		<p>Abilities are like superpowers, they give you some kinda control over a certain thing. Here is a list of abilites! (If you wanna see who has what abilites <a href="https://discord.gg/tgxtHANTnt">join the discord server</a>)</p>
		<ul>
			<li><p>Telekinesis</p></li>
			<li><p>Pyrokinesis</p></li>
			<li><p>Aerokinesis</p></li>
			<li><p>Hydrokinesis</p></li>
			<li><p>Geokinesis</p></li>
			<li><p>Azur Pyrokinesis</p></li>
			<li><p>Cryokinesis</p></li>
			<li><p>Tectokinesis</p></li>
			<li><p>Dimensikinesis</p></li>
			<li><p>Ferrokinesis</p></li>
		</ul>
		
		<h1>Alternate dimensions</h1>
		<p>The egg world uses the many worlds interpretation. The many worlds interpretation is basically where anytime a choice is made the world splits into two. One world for the first option and another world for the other option. For example, do I go down this creepy alleyway or not? There are now two universes, one where you went down the creepy alleyway, and one where you didn't.</p>
		<p>However, one extra rule for the egg server is that if you meet a you from another universe both you and the the other you are destroyed. The reason for this is because you and the other you have the opposite energy.</p>
		<p>A final thing about alternate dimensions is that they are currently inaccessible due to a device created by meggtech.</p>
		
		<h1 id="meggtech">Meggtech</h1>
		<p>Meggtech is a company created by Megging Soul. Meggtech was a secret but its existence is now public and has even been mentioned in the news. Meggtech invents and manufactures various devices and gadgets that are meant to help the public and the country.</p>
		<h2>Devices</h2>
		<p>This is a list of megg tech’s devices and their functions.</p>
		<ul>
		<li><p>Healer - Can heal most wounds after charging.</p></li>
		<li><p>Cloaking Device - Can hide someone's physical form with the click of a button.</p></li>
		<li><p>Pain’r Brain’r - Come in pairs, one dominant, once the dominant one's user thinks of a chosen word or image, the other one's user will be shocked.</p></li>
		<li><p>Boiler Boom - Makes the user immune to the Pain'r Brain'r and other mind manipulating devices.</p></li>
		<li><p>Roper - Upon a hard contact it shoots ropes out from its sides, entangling whatever it hit.</p></li>
